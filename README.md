# SQH Algorithm for Box-Cox Transformation Cure Rate Model

1) The file "SQH-BC-alp-binary.R" contains the data generation code using a binary covariate for a given value of the index parameter alpha. 
It also contains the SQH code and the NCG code for comparison.

2)  The file "SQH-BC-alp-cont.R" contains the data generation code using a continuous covariate for a given value of the index parameter alpha. 
It also contains the SQH code and the NCG code for comparison.
